  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Declining donor funding and competing health
              priorities threaten the sustainability of malaria programmes.
              Elucidating the cost and benefits of continued investments in
              malaria could encourage sustained political and financial
              commitments. The evidence, although available, remains disparate.
              This paper reviews the existing literature on the economic and
              financial cost and return of malaria control, elimination and
              eradication. METHODS: A review of articles that were published on
              or before September 2014 on the cost and benefits of malaria
              control and elimination was performed. Studies were classified
              based on their scope and were analysed according to two major
              categories: cost of malaria control and elimination to a health
              system, and cost-benefit studies. Only studies involving more
              than two control or elimination interventions were included.
              Outcomes of interest were total programmatic cost, cost per
              capita, and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). All costs were converted
              to 2013 US\$ for standardization. RESULTS: Of the 6425 articles
              identified, 54 studies were included in this review. Twenty-two
              were focused on elimination or eradication while 32 focused on
              intensive control. Forty-eight per cent of studies included in
              this review were published on or after 2000. Overall, the annual
              per capita cost of malaria control to a health system ranged from
              \$0.11 to \$39.06 (median: \$2.21) while that for malaria
              elimination ranged from \$0.18 to \$27 (median: \$3.00). BCRs of
              investing in malaria control and elimination ranged from 2.4 to
              over 145. CONCLUSION: Overall, investments needed for malaria
              control and elimination varied greatly amongst the various
              countries and contexts. In most cases, the cost of elimination
              was greater than the cost of control. At the same time, the
              benefits of investing in malaria greatly outweighed the costs.
              While the cost of elimination in most cases was greater than the
              cost of control, the benefits greatly outweighed the cost.
              Information from this review provides guidance to national
              malaria programmes on the cost and benefits of malaria
              elimination in the absence of data. Importantly, the review
              highlights the need for more robust economic analyses using
              standard inputs and methods to strengthen the evidence needed for
              sustained financing for malaria elimination.",

              human and economic development in malaria endemic countries. The
              impact of malaria can be categorized from three dimensions,
              namely: health, social and economic. The objective of this study
              was to estimate the impact of malaria morbidity on gross domestic
              product (GDP) of Uganda. METHODS: The impact of malaria morbidity
              on GDP of Uganda was estimated using double-log econometric
              model. The 1997-2003 time series macro-data used in the analysis
              were for 28 quarters, i.e. 7 years times 4 quarters per year. It
              was obtained from national and international secondary sources.
              RESULTS: The slope coefficient for Malaria Index (M) was
              -0.00767; which indicates that when malaria morbidity increases
              by one unit, while holding all other explanatory variables
              constant, per capita GDP decreases by US$0.00767 per year. In
              2003 Uganda lost US$ 49,825,003 of GDP due to malaria morbidity.
              Dividing the total loss of US$49.8 million by a population of
              25,827,000 yields a loss in GDP of US$1.93 per person in Uganda
              in 2003. CONCLUSION: Malaria morbidity results in a substantive
              loss in GDP of Uganda. The high burden of malaria leads to
              decreased long-term economic growth, and works against poverty
              eradication efforts and socioeconomic development of the country.",

              groups. Limited data are available on how obesity patterns differ
              across countries. OBJECTIVE: To document the prevalence of
              obesity and related health conditions for Europeans aged 50 years
              and older, and to estimate the association between obesity and
              health outcomes across 10 European countries. METHODS: Data were
              obtained from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in
              Europe, a cross-national survey of 22,777 Continental Europeans
              over the age of 50 years. The health outcomes included
              self-reported health, disability, doctor-diagnosed chronic health
              conditions and depression. Multivariate regression analysis was
              used to predict health outcomes across weight classes (defined by
              body mass index [BMI] from self-reported weight and height) in
              the pooled sample and individually in each country. RESULTS: The
              prevalence of obesity (BMI >or=30) ranged from 12.8\% in Sweden
              to 20.2\% in Spain for men and from 12.3\% in Switzerland to
              25.6\% in Spain for women. Adjusting for compositional
              differences across countries changed little in the observed large
              heterogeneity in obesity rates throughout Europe. Compared with
              normal weight individuals, men and women with greater BMI had
              significantly higher risks for all chronic health conditions
              examined except heart disease in overweight men. Depression was
              linked to obesity in women only. Particularly pronounced risks of
              impaired health and chronic health conditions were found among
              severely obese people. The effects of obesity on health did not
              vary significantly across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-country
              differences in the prevalence of obesity in older Europeans are
              substantial and exceed socio-demographic differentials in
              excessive body weight. Obesity is associated with significantly
              poorer health outcomes among Europeans aged 50 years and over,
              with effects similar across countries. Large heterogeneity in
              obesity throughout Europe should be investigated further to

              indoor residual spraying (IRS) to case management in Afghan
              refugee settlements in Pakistan during a prolonged malaria
              epidemic. METHODS/FINDINGS: An intervention study design was
              selected, taking a societal perspective. Provider and household
              costs of vector control and case management were collected from
              provider records and community survey. Health outcomes (e.g.
              cases and DALYs averted) were derived and incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for cases prevented and DALYs
              averted calculated. Population, treatment cost, women's time,
              days of productivity lost, case fatality rate, cases prevented,
              and DALY assumptions were tested in sensitivity analysis. Malaria
              incidence peaked at 44/1,000 population in year 2, declining to
              14/1,000 in year 5. In total, 370,000 malaria cases, 80\% vivax,
              were diagnosed and treated and an estimated 67,988 vivax cases
              and 18,578 falciparum and mixed cases prevented. Mean annual
              programme cost per capita was US\$0.56. The additional cost of
              including IRS over five years per case prevented was US\$39;
              US\$50 for vivax (US\$43 in years 1-3, US\$80 in years 4-5) and
              US\$182 for falciparum (US\$139 in years 1-3 and US\$680 in years
              4-5). Per DALY averted this was US\$266 (US\$220 in years 1-3 and
              US\$486 in years 4-5) and thus 'highly cost-effective' or
              cost-effective using WHO and comparison thresholds. CONCLUSIONS:
              Adding IRS was cost-effective in this moderate endemicity, low
              mortality setting. It was more cost-effective when transmission
              was highest, becoming less so as transmission reduced. Because
              vivax was three times more common than falciparum and the case
              fatality rate was low, cost-effectiveness estimations for cases
              prevented appear reliable and more definitive for vivax malaria.",

  abstract={This paper proposes a very simple test of Granger (1969) non-causality for hetero- geneous panel data models. Our test statistic is based on the individual Wald statistics of Granger non causality averaged across the cross-section units. First, this statistic is shown to converge sequentially to a standard normal distribution. Second, the semi- asymptotic distribution of the average statistic is characterized for a fixed T sample. A standardized statistic based on an approximation of the moments of Wald statistics is hence proposed. Third, Monte Carlo experiments show that our standardized panel statistics have very good small sample properties, even in the presence of cross-sectional dependence.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The control and elimination of malaria requires
              expanded coverage of and access to effective malaria control
              interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor
              residual spraying (IRS), intermittent preventive treatment (IPT),
              diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment. Decisions on how to
              scale up the coverage of these interventions need to be based on
              evidence of programme effectiveness, equity and
              cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic review of the published
              literature on the costs and cost-effectiveness of malaria
              interventions was undertaken. All costs and cost-effectiveness
              ratios were inflated to 2009 USD to allow comparison of the costs
              and benefits of several different interventions through various
              delivery channels, across different geographical regions and from
              varying costing perspectives. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies of the
              costs and forty three studies of the cost-effectiveness of
              malaria interventions were identified, 78\% of which were
              undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa, 18\% in Asia and 4\% in South
              America. The median financial cost of protecting one person for
              one year was \$2.20 (range \$0.88-\$9.54) for ITNs, \$6.70 (range
              \$2.22-\$12.85) for IRS, \$0.60 (range \$0.48-\$1.08) for IPT in
              infants, \$4.03 (range \$1.25-\$11.80) for IPT in children, and
              \$2.06 (range \$0.47-\$3.36) for IPT in pregnant women. The
              median financial cost of diagnosing a case of malaria was \$4.32
              (range \$0.34-\$9.34). The median financial cost of treating an
              episode of uncomplicated malaria was \$5.84 (range
              \$2.36-\$23.65) and the median financial cost of treating an
              episode of severe malaria was \$30.26 (range \$15.64-\$137.87).
              Economies of scale were observed in the implementation of ITNs,
              IRS and IPT, with lower unit costs reported in studies with
              larger numbers of beneficiaries. From a provider perspective, the
              median incremental cost effectiveness ratio per disability
              adjusted life year averted was \$27 (range \$8.15-\$110) for
              ITNs, \$143 (range \$135-\$150) for IRS, and \$24 (range
              \$1.08-\$44.24) for IPT. CONCLUSIONS: A transparent evidence base
              on the costs and cost-effectiveness of malaria control
              interventions is provided to inform rational resource allocation
              by donors and domestic health budgets and the selection of
              optimal packages of interventions by malaria control programmes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite the significant gains made globally in
              reducing the burden of malaria, the disease remains a major
              public health challenge, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
              including Ghana. There is a significant gap in financing malaria
              control globally. The private sector could become a significant
              source of financing malaria control. To get the private sector to
              appreciate the need to invest in malaria control, it is important
              to provide evidence of the economic burden of malaria on
              businesses. The objective of this study, therefore, was to
              estimate the economic burden on malaria on businesses in Ghana,
              so as to stimulate the sector's investment in malaria control.
              METHODS: Data covering 2012-2014 were collected from 62
              businesses sampled from Greater Accra, Ashanti and Western
              Regions of Ghana, which have the highest concentration of
              businesses in the country. Data on the cost of businesses'
              spending on treatment and prevention of malaria in staff and
              their dependants as well as staff absenteeism due to malaria and
              expenditure on other health-related activities were collected.
              Views of business leaders on the effect of malaria on their
              businesses were also compiled. The analysis was extrapolated to
              cover 5828 businesses across the country. RESULTS: The results
              show that businesses in Ghana lost about US\$6.58 million to
              malaria in 2014, 90 \% of which were direct costs. A total of
              3913 workdays were lost due to malaria in firms in the study
              sample during the period 2012-2014. Businesses in the study
              sample spent an average of 0.5 \% of the annual corporate returns
              on treatment of malaria in employees and their dependants, 0.3 \%
              on malaria prevention, and 0.5 \% on other health-related
              corporate social responsibilities. Again business leaders
              affirmed that malaria affects their businesses' efficiency,
              employee attendance and productivity and expenses. Finally, about
              93 \% of business leaders expressed the need private sector
              investment in malaria control. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden
              of malaria on businesses in Ghana cannot be underestimated. This,
              together with business leaders' acknowledgement that it is
              important for private sector investment in malaria control,
              provides motivation for engagement of the private sector in
              financing malaria control activities.",
